# Haseeb Khan â€” Fullâ€‘Stack Developer & AI Engineer

## Hello, I'm Haseeb ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old developer from BahawalNagar, Pakistan, who fell in love with code at a young age. What started as curiosity about "how websites work" has grown into a passion for building digital experiences that actually matter to people.

**Full Name:** Haseeb Ahmed Raza Khan  
**Born:** February 14, 2007  
**Current Focus:** Building intelligent web applications and AI tools that solve real problems  
**Location:** BahawalNagar, Pakistan (but I work with teams worldwide)

## My Story

Growing up in a small Pakistani town, I didn't have access to fancy coding bootcamps or Silicon Valley mentors. What I had was curiosity, an internet connection, and the determination to figure things out.

After completing my intermediate education in Computer Science at KIPS College (where I ranked 14th in board exams), I made what many thought was a risky decision: I chose to skip university and spend a year diving deep into web development instead.

That year changed everything. While my classmates were attending lectures, I was:
- Building my first React applications
- Learning Next.js from the ground up
- Mastering animation with GSAP
- Creating real projects for real users

The gamble paid off. Figmenta Agency found my work online, interviewed me, and offered me a position. Since then, I've been building websites, SaaS products, and AI tools that are used by people around the world.

## What I Actually Do

I don't just write codeâ€”I solve problems. Here's what that looks like:

**For Businesses:** I build complete web experiences from design to deployment. Whether you need a stunning brand website or a full SaaS platform, I handle the entire process.

**For Entrepreneurs:** I help turn ideas into working products. From the initial concept to user authentication, payments, and beyond.

**For Teams:** I create AI-powered tools that actually save time and money. Think smart chatbots, document processing systems, and automation workflows.

## The Technology I Use

I believe in using the right tool for the job, not just the newest shiny framework:

**Frontend:** Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GSAP (for those smooth animations)  
**Backend:** Node.js, FastAPI, Express  
**Databases:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Supabase  
**AI & Data:** LangChain, OpenAI API, custom embedding pipelines  
**Hosting:** Vercel, because deployment should be painless  

## Some Things I've Built

**Real Websites for Real Businesses:**
- [Figmenta Agency](https://figmenta.com) - Where I work, helping brands tell their stories
- [Uptraction](https://uptraction.com) - Growth consultancy platform
- [Seaside Transportation](https://seaside-transportation.com) - Local business website
- [Isodomi](https://isodomi.nl) - Netherlands-based construction company

**SaaS Products:**
- [AssessGPT](https://assess-gpt.com) - AI tool that helps teachers grade assignments
- [Sentriq](https://sentriq.io) - Cybersecurity platform

**Developer Tools I Use Daily:**
- [Gitignore Generator](https://gitignore-generator.netlify.app) - Because nobody memorizes .gitignore files
- [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatteronline.site) - For when APIs return messy data
- [URL Shortener](https://shortener.haseebkhan.online) - Simple, clean, works

## How I Work

**For New Projects:** I start with understanding what you're actually trying to achieve. Not just "I need a website" but "I need to convert visitors into customers" or "I need to automate this repetitive task."

**For Existing Projects:** I can jump in, understand your codebase, and start contributing immediately. Clean code and good documentation aren't just nice-to-havesâ€”they're requirements.

**For Teams:** I believe in clear communication, regular updates, and building things that won't break the moment I'm not around.

## Pricing That Makes Sense

**Quick Landing Page:** $500 - Perfect for getting your business online fast  
**SaaS MVP:** $1,500 - Everything you need to validate your idea and get first users  
**Custom AI Tools:** Let's talk - depends on complexity and requirements  
**Hourly Consulting:** $30/hour - For code reviews, debugging, or technical guidance  

*I offer discounts for Pakistani clients, educational projects, and nonprofits because I believe good technology should be accessible.*

## A Personal Note

I'm not your typical developer. I don't have a computer science degree, I didn't go to a prestigious university, and I didn't start with any special advantages. What I have is genuine curiosity about how things work, the persistence to figure out problems, and the belief that good software should make people's lives easier.

Every line of code I write is with real users in mind. Every feature I build is tested by real people. Every project I take on is an opportunity to create something that actually matters.

If you're looking for someone who treats your project like their own, who communicates clearly, and who builds things that last, let's talk.
